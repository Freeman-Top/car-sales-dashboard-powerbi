Car Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project Report
1. Project Background
Our company is a car dealership that offers a variety of car models to customers across different regions. To monitor and improve our sales performance, we identified the need for a centralized, data-driven dashboard. This project aims to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes our car sales and tracks critical key performance indicators (KPIs).

This report documents the structure, KPIs, visualizations, and insights gained from the development and analysis of the Car Sales Dashboard.

Note: This project was replicated as part of a learning exercise based on a Power BI tutorial created by Data Tutorials on YouTube. The structure and techniques used in the dashboard were inspired by this tutorial to strengthen practical Power BI and DAX skills.

2. Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Develop a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for car sales analysis.

Enable decision-makers to track sales performance in real-time.

Use KPIs to identify trends, growth opportunities, and performance gaps.

Enhance the ability to make data-driven business decisions.

3. Data Overview
The dataset used includes:

Car model, body style, color

Sale date, dealer region, and sales company

Sales amount and quantity

Time-based breakdown (weekly, monthly, yearly)

4. KPIs Implemented
The dashboard includes the following key performance indicators:

4.1 Sales Overview
Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales

Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales

Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth

Difference between YTD and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales

4.2 Average Price Analysis
YTD Average Price

MTD Average Price

YOY Growth in Average Price

Difference between YTD and PTYD Average Price

4.3 Cars Sold Metrics
YTD Cars Sold

MTD Cars Sold

YOY Growth in Cars Sold

Difference between YTD and PTYD Cars Sold

5. Visualizations & Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard consists of multiple pages, including:

5.1 Dashboard Overview
Line Chart showing YTD weekly sales trend

Pie Charts representing YTD sales by body style and color

Cards/Indicators displaying total sales, cars sold, and average price

5.2 Regional Analysis
Map Chart to visualize YTD cars sold by dealer region

Identification of high- and low-performing locations

5.3 Company-Wise Analysis
Grid Table comparing YTD sales for each company

5.4 Detailed Data Table
A full sales dataset including model, body style, color, region, sale amount, and date

Enables sorting, searching, and export

6. Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures

Microsoft Excel / CSV as the data source

7. Key Insights Gained
Certain body styles and car colors significantly influence total sales.

Dealer regions show varied performance, with some regions requiring targeted attention.

YOY growth in both sales amount and average price indicates a positive upward trend.

Company-specific breakdowns highlight sales dominance and performance gaps.

8. Learning Outcomes
This project improved my ability to:

Build business dashboards using Power BI

Write and apply advanced DAX expressions for time-based calculations

Use visuals effectively for KPI storytelling

Transform raw data into actionable insights

9. Acknowledgment
This dashboard project was built by following a YouTube tutorial created by Data Tutorials for learning purposes. All visuals, DAX formulas, and layout concepts were replicated and adapted for educational growth.

10. Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides a centralized, insightful, and actionable view of car sales performance. It supports better decision-making by offering real-time visibility into sales trends and metrics. The hands-on experience replicating this project strengthened my understanding of Power BI’s capabilities in a business context.
